  # About

    title: "About Me"
    image: ""
    content: |-
      I co-founded [67 Bricks Ltd.](https://67bricks.com/) with Sam Herbert, and grew it to be a respected and
      award-winning company with over 40 employees. We work with major information providers such as the __Economist Intelligence Unit__, 
      __Taylor and Francis__, __Springer Nature__, and the __British Medical Journal__. 
      
      I enjoyed every aspect of building the company,
      including talking to our customers and understanding their problems; strategic technical decision making as CTO; 
      hiring and managing a talented team; and hands-on software development. We've always been innovative and have been working with AI 
      for the last decade, and I'm very excited about the new possibilities that generative AI provides. 
      I'm also proud to have founded a company that has always cared about its impact on society and on the environment. 
      
      With 67 Bricks now independently thriving, I'm looking at new areas where I can apply my expertise. 
      In particular, I believe that climate change is the most important problem that we face today,
      and software solutions can help address this critical global challenge.
